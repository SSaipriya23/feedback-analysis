                                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
                                a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                                like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established
                                fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
                                The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
                                to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
                                ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
                                years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
